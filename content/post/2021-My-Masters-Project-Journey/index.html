<h3>By Mandhri Abeysooriya</h3>
<p>I was initially introduced to field of bioinformatics during my Bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>Main reason why I selected Deakin University to do my masters is because Deakin offers Master’s in biotechnology and Bioinformatics.
When it was time to choose a topic of interest for the final year project, I hesitated a bit to choose bioinformatics based projects since I had more experience in wet labs rather than dry labs.
Athough I was not confident to choose a dry lab-based project, I also wanted to gain more experience in computational biology.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Ziemann was the unit chair for the “Research impact and management” unit during my first semester and I learned he was an active researcher in bioinformatics.
His teaching skills were so remarkable that even after 2 years of time, I still remember most of the details of that unit he taught us (and moreover I do remember that he marked our assignments so accurately that he even reduced marks for the missing punctuation!).
This made me realise that he is a perfectionist in the work he does.
The fact that he is an expert in Bioinformatics as well as he is being a perfectionist in the work he does, I arrived at the conclusion that I am in good hands if I want to improve my bioinformatics skills.</p>
<p>I am an individual who is keen in learning new things and not shy to take on new challenges.
I have never in my life coded in any computer language before.
I remember during the initial weeks of my Master’s project, I used to sit by my desk from the morning till night and work on improving my coding skills in R language.
It was because of my dedication and my supervisor’s systematic and methodical guidance that I was able to excel coding in R and my bioinformatics skills more broadly.</p>
<p>My final year project was supposed to be <em>“A meta-analysis on the effect of homocysteine in DNA methylation and gene expression”</em>.
I was not able to conduct the proposed meta-analysis due to unavailability of most of the published datasets.
We were only able to find one data set via GEO through a paper published by Kok et al (2015), and of the remaining 8 publications, were unable to obtain the corresponding microarray datasets which was very disappointing.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to adopt to the situation where my final year project composed of two mini projects titled as “<em>An assessment of the association of homocysteine of DNA methylation</em>” and “<em>Gene name errors: Lessons not learned</em>”.</p>
<p>Via the first mini project, I was so fascinated with all the data I was able to produce, and this mini project related to homocysteine and DNA methylation made me realise that there are much more towards the genetics than what I have known through all my life.</p>
<p>My second mini project was based on erroneous gene symbol conversion to dates in supplementary data files.
I used to be a fan of Microsoft Excel, but I never knew the fact that Excel could alter data like this.
I was quite shocked to see how many world-renowned journals contained so many errors in their supplementary files.
I came to know that gene symbol alteration could impact the data and research reproducibility.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was not certain as to what I want to do with my life or what type of a career I want to pursue.
For most of my life, I was given a syllabus and was instructed to follow so.
I have learnt so much during my Master’s course at Deakin, and I am so happy that the hard work I have put in is starting to open up new opportunities for me to begin a PhD project.
This Master’s research project with Dr Ziemann opened my eyes to a whole new horizon of knowledge.</p>
<p>For the first time, I now know what I want to do with my life and what type of career I want to pursue.</p>
