Based at Burnet Institute, Melbourne and with members also at Deakin University,
the group is focused on enhancing our understanding of human health and disease
using big omics data and computational biology.

To achieve this, the group actively collaborates with researchers at Burnet and
beyond with consultation, training and coordination of bioinformatics analysis.
We are also interested in contributing to bioinformatics infrastructure by
building data resources and software tools to accelerate biomedical discovery.

A secondary focus of our group is methodological rigour and reproducibility,
which is critical translating 'omics research into tangible impacts to health.

Our group is committed to open science, diversity and community engagement.

# Dr Mark Ziemann's Biosketch

Mark earned his PhD at Swinburne University (2010) in the field of plant molecular genetics under the supervision of Prof Mrinal Bhave and Prof Sabine Zachgo.
He then completed an 8-year post-doctoral position at Baker Institute and Monash University under the mentorship of Prof Sam El-Osta using next gen sequencing to study the epigenetics of complex diseases including diabetes and heart disease.
From 2018-2023, he was Lecturer of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at Deakin University, and research is focused on developing methods and datasets to better understand gene regulation in disease.
In 2021 he was awarded a Graduate Certificate in Higher Education and is using these skills to improve the quality of genomics and computational biology teaching at Deakin.
In August 2023 he was appointed to Head of Bioinformatics at Burnet Institute, Melbourne, to strengthen capabilities in this growing area.
