Kingsley earned his bachelor degree in biochemistry in 2018 from The Federal University of Technology in Nigeria.
Kingsley joined the group in February 2021 to complete a masters project investigating the impacts of genetic variation among inbred mice on experimental findings. 
During his Bachelor's degree, Kingsley co-authored a publication on Biochemical and liver histological changes in rats exposed to sub-lethal dose of Uproot-pesticide and the protective potentials of nutritional supplements.
Kingsley will be completing his Masters project in November 2021 and will be looking for opportunities to start a PhD project or work as a bioinformatics or biotechnology research assistant in Australia or abroad. Kingsley loves the beach, dogs, and
enjoys playing snooker.
