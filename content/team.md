Megan earned her Bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering in 2015 from the Cebu Institute of Technology - University.
After working as an engineer in the Philippines, she enrolled in a masters program and joined the group in July 2020 to complete a Masters project.
She is investigating the functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) through machine learning and data analytics and will be completing her project in November 2021.
Megan loves reading, hiking, and bouncing off ideas with friends over a cup of coffee.
She is a Study Geelong Ambassador and is part of the Study Melbourne Leadership Labs 4Impact in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2021.
Megan believes good science necessitates good communication.
So, on top of striving to be a good researcher, she constantly strives to improve her communication skills by writing about her journey as a bioinformatician in her blog.
