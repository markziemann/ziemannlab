      <description>By Mandhri Abeysooriya I was initially introduced to field of bioinformatics during my Bachelor’s degree.
Main reason why I selected Deakin University to do my masters is because Deakin offers Master’s in biotechnology and Bioinformatics. When it was time to choose a topic of interest for the final year project, I hesitated a bit to choose bioinformatics based projects since I had more experience in wet labs rather than dry labs.</description>
