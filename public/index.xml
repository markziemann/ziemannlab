      <description>Pathway enrichment analysis is among the most frequently used types of computational biology analysis, enabling us to better interpret and summarise massive gene regulation datasets into a manageable list of pathways.
While this is truly powerful, most pathway analysis tools are limited to a single comparison, which is a problem if the dataset consists of multiple sample groups, for example if we are working with an multiple disease and treatment groups, as tends to be the case for most omics experiments undertaken these days.</description>

      <description>The Digital Expression Explorer (DEE) project is one of the flagship projects for the Ziemann Computational Biology lab. Since 2015, the project has strived to deliver processed RNA-seq data into the public domain. If you have ever had to process this type of gene expression data you will know that it requires a great deal of computational power and expertise at using command-line tools. This means that most researchers, students and hobbyists are excluded from undertaking this sort of analysis.</description>

      <description>Site under construction Jane Bloggs Jane earned her Bachelor degree in astrophysics in 2019 from the University of Queensland. She joined the group in Febrary 2021 to complete a Masters project investigating pathway level understanding of single cell transcriptomics data. She will be completing her project in November 2021 and will be looking for opportunities to start a PhD project or work as a bioinformatics research assistant in Australia or abroad.</description>

      <description>The group is based at Deakin University Geelong, Australia with members across the Geelong and Melbourne. Our group is focused on building data resources and software tools to accelerate biomedical discovery. We collaborate closely with clinicians and biologists to get the most out of their &amp;lsquo;omics experiments. Our lab is committed to reproducibility, open science, and diversity.
Dr Mark Ziemann&amp;rsquo;s Biosketch Mark earned his PhD at Swinburne University (2010) in the field of plant molecular genetics under the supervision of Prof Mrinal Bhave and Prof Sabine Zachgo.</description>
