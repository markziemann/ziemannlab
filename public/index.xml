      <description>By Mandhri Abeysooriya I was initially introduced to field of bioinformatics during my Bachelor’s degree.
Main reason why I selected Deakin University to do my masters is because Deakin offers Master’s in biotechnology and Bioinformatics. When it was time to choose a topic of interest for the final year project, I hesitated a bit to choose bioinformatics based projects since I had more experience in wet labs rather than dry labs.</description>

      <description>Site under construction Mandhri Dushyanthi Abeysooriya Mandhri earned her Bachelor’s degree in a combination of biotechnology, biochemistry and genetics from Bangalore university, India in year 2017 and her Master’s degree in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics from Deakin university, Australia in 2021. Mandhri joined the Ziemann lab in 2020 to complete her Master’s research project to investigate the effect of Homocysteine on DNA methylation and gene expression. She was able to achieve distinction for her Master’s thesis project and was able to first author a manuscript entitled “Gene Name Errors: Lessons Not Learned”.</description>

      <description>Pathway enrichment analysis is among the most frequently used types of computational biology analysis, enabling us to better interpret and summarise massive gene regulation datasets into a manageable list of pathways.
While this is truly powerful, most pathway analysis tools are limited to a single comparison, which is a problem if the dataset consists of multiple sample groups, for example if we are working with an multiple disease and treatment groups, as tends to be the case for most omics experiments undertaken these days.</description>

      <description>The Digital Expression Explorer (DEE) project is one of the flagship projects for the Ziemann Computational Biology lab. Since 2015, the project has strived to deliver processed RNA-seq data into the public domain. If you have ever had to process this type of gene expression data you will know that it requires a great deal of computational power and expertise at using command-line tools. This means that most researchers, students and hobbyists are excluded from undertaking this sort of analysis.</description>

      <description>The group is based at Deakin University Geelong, Australia with members across the Geelong and Melbourne. Our group is focused on building data resources and software tools to accelerate biomedical discovery. We collaborate closely with clinicians and biologists to get the most out of their &amp;lsquo;omics experiments. Our lab is committed to reproducibility, open science, and diversity.
Dr Mark Ziemann&amp;rsquo;s Biosketch Mark earned his PhD at Swinburne University (2010) in the field of plant molecular genetics under the supervision of Prof Mrinal Bhave and Prof Sabine Zachgo.</description>
