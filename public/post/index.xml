      <description>Pathway enrichment analysis is among the most frequently used types of computational biology analysis, enabling us to better interpret and summarise massive gene regulation datasets into a manageable list of pathways.
While this is truly powerful, most pathway analysis tools are limited to a single comparison, which is a problem if the dataset consists of multiple sample groups, for example if we are working with an multiple disease and treatment groups, as tends to be the case for most omics experiments undertaken these days.</description>

      <description>The Digital Expression Explorer (DEE) project is one of the flagship projects for the Ziemann Computational Biology lab. Since 2015, the project has strived to deliver processed RNA-seq data into the public domain. If you have ever had to process this type of gene expression data you will know that it requires a great deal of computational power and expertise at using command-line tools. This means that most researchers, students and hobbyists are excluded from undertaking this sort of analysis.</description>
